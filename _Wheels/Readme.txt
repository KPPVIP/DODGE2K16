[Features]

- 8 Rims


[Installation]

Use OpenIV to make these changes.

  -(ADD-ON)-
1. Add new line close to the bottom:
<Item>dlcpacks:\dodgerims\</Item>
to file .\update\update.rpf\common\data\dlclist.xml

2. Copy the dodgerims folder into the dlcpacks folder:
.\update\x64\dlcpacks\dodgerims

3. Open the Veshare.ytd on these locations (remember to make a BACKUP of these files):
.\Grand Theft Auto V\x64w.rpf\dlcpacks\mpbeach\dlc.rpf\x64\levels\gta5\vehicles\mpbeachvehicles.rpf\vehshare.ytd
.\Grand Theft Auto V\x64e.rpf\levels\gta5\vehicles.rpf\vehshare.ytd

	And move all the *.dds files (inside folder "Vehshare.ytd textures") into the opened veshare.ytd file.
	Select Automatic compression.
	Hit the Save button (bottom right).
	Do this for both veshare.ytd files.

	NOTE: If you game crashes or is stuck on launch try to restore the veshare.ytd files. 
	Too many textures (~190+?) in a veshare.ytd file will crash the game.

4. Use a trainer to change the rims (Sports section).
